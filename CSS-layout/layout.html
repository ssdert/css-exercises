    <h2>THREE PRINCIPLES FOR GOOD DESIGN</h2>
  </article>

  <article class="first">
    <h1>“As designers, we have a great responsibility.”</h1>
    <p>Dieter Rams</p>
  </article>

  <article class="second">
      <h1><span class="span-position">01</span>Good design is 
         innovative
         <p>            The possibilities for innovation are not, by any
            means, exhausted. Technological development
            is always offering new opportunities for 
            innovative design. But innovative design always 
            develops in tandem with innovative technology, 
            and can never be an end in itself.</p>

  <article class="third">
      <h1><span class="span-position">02</span>Good design makes a 
         product useful
         <p>           A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy 
           certain criteria, not only functional, but also 
           psychological and aesthetic. Good design 
           emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst 
           disregarding anything that could possibly 
           detract from it.</p>

  <article class="fourth">
      <h1><span class="span-position">03</span>Good design is aesthetic

         <p>           The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to 
           its usefulness because products we use every 
           day affect our person and our well-being. But 
           only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</p>
