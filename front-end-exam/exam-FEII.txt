Code and style a simple website for a vegan restaurant. It should consist of two files, the html and the css file.

The website should consist of :
* An introductory section with a mission statement, introduction or similar
* A menu section with two menus, each containing 5 dishes with titles and descriptions
* A contact section with a "get your menu delivered" form
* A footer with copyright information and links to social channels
* You should produce all your content, come up with a restaurant name and concept

1.) HTML

Define your metadata (description, author, viewport).

Write semantic HTML that will validate.

Structure your page semantically using these elements:
article, aside, footer, header, main, nav, section

Structure your content semantically using these elements:
p, h1 - hy6, ul, ol, li, a, strong, em, img

Code your form using:
button, form, fields, input, label, textarea

For each new element you introduce write a comment explaining why you chose it (even elements in the head  of the document)

2.) CSS

Give your page some love by styling it. Use your knowledge of:
* selectors (use meaningful classes to style your content, remember DRY and KISS)
* units (px, em, rem)
* font styling (font-, text,-...)
* box model (margin, border, padding, box sizing,...)

Use consistent writing style and spacing when writing code.

Place the files with the following names in the exam folder:
YourName-exam.html
YourName-exam.css

Good luck!
