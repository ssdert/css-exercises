      <p> Since the 1960s and 1970s boom of international style high-rise
          construction, reflecting surfaces have become the shimmering face of
          capital flows and power dynamics. Employing mirrors as an illusionary,
          camouflaging agent, this representational regime offers a paradoxical
          discourse that disguises power by reflecting the outside onto itself</p>
          
      <p> Presenting twenty artists and collectives, the biennial foregrounds the
          curators’ take on the current status of the moving image, building on the
          idea that the main model of encountering moving images has shifted from
          collectively projected events in large spaces to individualized experiences
          grounded in static or mobile flat-screen devices. The screenings explore
          such frictions by presenting works displaying various shapes of engagement
          between the individual and the social.</p>
          
      <p> Today the regime of reflection has been supposedly replaced by a narrative
          produced during the digital turn and embodied by Silicon Valley:the myth of
          transparency, in which it is proclai med that a heightened degree of
          communication and interdependence will make societies more cohesive and
          controllable, and less prone to abuse. "Fitter, happier, more productive."</p>

      <p> Using the personal standpoint of an extended and often humorous
          monologue, This Action Lies weaves together a large socioeconomic
          constellation around such an underappreciated commercial product.
          The work’s impactful mise en abyme emerging out of the several visual
          reframings and the text’s form and content, drawing disparate references
          wrapped in a monotonous and confessional tone, produces a powerful
          statement regarding the interpenetration of the social in the self, while
          echoing the history of experimental film, referencing Hollis Frampton or
          Morgan Fisher.</p>

    <p> If on the one hand implosion as concept-image
        mimics the fragmentation and dissolution
        of the traditional collective experience with
        the visual, on the other it also signals the
        ambition to counter act or at least critique
        such atomization. Indeed and on a literal note,
        the figure of the mobile phone or the tablet
        as a means to display images, so common in
        contemporary art contexts just a few years
        ago, is notably absent. Inversely, the biennial
        privileges large-scale projected images
        contextualized in expanded environments
        where sculpture and/or architecture play an
        important role, a gesture emphasizing the
        physicality of space and body in the encounter
        with images, which was also key to the
        visceral performance program showcasing
        Elysia Crampton, Ligia Lewis, Pan Daijing,
        and Angela Dimayuga and Meriem Bennani’s
        performative dinner.</p>
    
    <p> The film is "a paranoid polyphonic apology of a simple act"
        offering three perspectives of a simple object: a Styrofoam
        to-go cup.</p>

    <p> Proposing touching by means other than
        physical contact as a possible action, the work
        propels a form of spirituality, exploring being
        human in the age of multiple information
        processing.Meriem Bennani’s multichannel
        Party on the CAPS (2018)imagines a
        world reconfigured by biotechnology and
        teleportation. Taking place on an isolated
        island in the Atlantic Ocean, it reflects on
        the physical and psychological displacement
        imposed on refugees and immigrants by
        states worldwide.</p>

    <p> Displacement is also explored by Lawrence
        Abu Hamdan, whose work draws from the
        current increase of fortified borders, which
        has expanded from fifteen in 2000 to today’s
        sixty-three. Walled Unwalled (2018) connects
        this context with the concurrent discovery
        of muons, invisible cosmic particles that
        pass through surfaces impervious to X-rays,
        penetrating what were once regarded as
        established boundaries.</p>

    <p> On the CAC’s top floor, Tamara Henderson’s
        Womb Life (2018) forefronts the silenced
        materiality of apparatus, bodies, and images.
        Her installations “choreograph space as a
        film set,” approaching“the floor as though
        it were a continuous connected body and
        transforming it into a system which is both
        kinetic and still.” Such concern around spatial
        configuration and materiality is explored
        throughout the exhibition.</p>

    <p> Abu Hamdan’s ongoing exploration of physical and visual limits also manifested in the biennial’s
        opening party, which acted as a powerful statement regarding the pervasive contemporary
        regime of hypervisibility. At the club night hosted by Nkisi, presenting COLD WAR (Nkisi/John
        T. Gast), Crystallmess, and the extraordinary Abyss X, the dominance of vision was erased
        by a darkened, opaque, smoked space punctuated by irregular laser lights and deep sounds.
        The sensorial environmentmolded the audience into a single body, an anonymous mass
        whose empathy for one another organically counteracted the isolation key to the age of selfrepresentation,
        and at the same time implemented a regime of invisibility.</p>

    <p> The enactment of such a fascinating, visceral kaleidoscope where vision was shaped by the
        movement of sound and bodies in space demonstrated the possibility of a shared moment of
        difference and otherness. Aptly echoing the antimatter research undertaken nearby at CERN,
        the event enacted a passage from the reflection of the outsideand the monetization of the
        inside to a shared refraction of the self, together expressing interiority in an environment that
        forcibly reverberated to the radiant sound of screens imploding.</p>
